# ThriftIt
We are team 'Overworked' - the underpaid unpaid interns slaving for our projects.

Our project, 'ThriftIt', is an e-commerce app in the second-hand clothing market. Individuals (called Buyers) can purchase second-hand clothing items at great prices. Businesses can sell items through our portal too!

This repo contains 3 component codebases:
- Backend: Business logic and database management.
- Frontend: Web application UI for Buyers.
